# UK Minister Meetings

An ongoing attempt to collect and standardise information released on the external meetings of UK ministers. The data originally comes from the UK government site [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications), and can only be as clean/complete as the data provided there. 

The (very) rough code used to standardise the data can be found [here](https://github.com/ijmbarr/ti_intergrity_watch).
